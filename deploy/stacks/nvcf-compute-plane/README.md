# nvcf-compute-plane-stack

Helmfile stack for the NVCF compute plane. Installs the NVCA operator and optional
ML-framework operators (Grove, Dynamo) onto GPU clusters registered with an NVCF control plane.

## Prerequisites

- An NVCF control plane deployed via `nvcf-self-managed-stack`
- `helmfile` v1.1.x (v1.2.0+ breaks ordering; see version note below)
- `helm` v3.x
- `helm-diff` plugin
- `nvcf-cli` (for cluster registration)
- A kubeconfig pointing at the target GPU cluster

## Quickstart

```sh
# 1. Register the cluster with ICMS (idempotent)
make register-cluster \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-east \
  NCA_ID=nvcf-default \
  CLUSTER_REGION=us-west-1 \
  ICMS_URL=https://sis.your-nvcf.example.com

# 2. Deploy the compute plane
make install \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-east \
  HELMFILE_ENV=<env>
```

Repeat steps 1-2 for each GPU cluster (see [this example](#multi-cluster-example)).
The `CLUSTER_NAME` variable scopes all state to
that cluster so multiple clusters can be managed from a single checkout.
`register-cluster` writes `registration/<cluster>-register-values.yaml`.
`install`, `apply`, and `template` copy that file into `out/` before running
Helmfile.

`HELMFILE_ENV` maps to `environments/<env>.yaml`. Source checkouts include a
`local` environment for development. Release archives ship `base.yaml`; create
an environment file for your registry and service endpoints, then pass its name
without the `.yaml` suffix.

## Observability

The stack defaults `observability.profile` to `compute`. The `compute` and
`all` profiles enable the NVCA collector and `BYOObservability` feature gate.
The `control` and `disabled` profiles leave both off.

One value selects the normal behavior:

```yaml
observability:
  profile: compute
```

Explicit NVCA values override the profile defaults:

```yaml
global:
  nvcaOperator:
    selfManaged:
      otelCollector:
        enabled: false
      featureGateValues:
        - "-BYOObservability"
```

## Chart and Image Sources

The stack pins the NVCA operator chart in
`helmfile.d/02-nvca.yaml.gotmpl`. Compute-plane base values supply the tested
NVCA, NVCA operator, and OTel collector image tags. The chart supplies the
image credential helper and shared storage image tags.

Use `global.helm.sources` for chart repository location and `global.image` for
container image repository location. The stack rewrites repositories through
those global values, while chart defaults supply the tested image tags.
Only set `global.nvcaOperator.selfManaged.imageCredHelper.imageTag` when
pinning a tested replacement helper image.

## Helmfile Version Note

Helmfile v1.2.0+ changed `helmfile.d/` processing to parallel mode which breaks
implicit ordering. Use helmfile v1.1.x:

```sh
# Pinned binaries are auto-downloaded by the dev Makefile:
make install CLUSTER_NAME=...   # downloads helmfile v1.1.9 + helm v3.15.4 on first run
```

## Optional Add-ons

The stack can install KAI Scheduler, Grove, and Dynamo. KAI provides resource
allocation and gang placement, Grove orchestrates related Pod groups, and
Dynamo describes inference services that Grove manages. GPU clique
topology-aware scheduling connects those workloads to the cluster's NVLink
topology.

All add-ons are disabled by default. Grove requires KAI Scheduler, and Dynamo
requires Grove. Topology-aware scheduling also requires KAI Scheduler. Enable
the complete stack in `environments/<env>.yaml`:

```yaml
addons:
  topologyAwareScheduling:
    enabled: true
  kaiScheduler:
    enabled: true
  groveOperator:
    enabled: true
  dynamoOperator:
    enabled: true
```

Override KAI component resources under `addons.kaiScheduler.<component>.resources`
(for example `addons.kaiScheduler.scheduler.resources.requests.memory`). Defaults
are set in `helmfile.d/01-dependencies.yaml.gotmpl`.

`addons.topologyAwareScheduling` installs cluster-scoped KAI `Topology`
resources from `topologyAwareScheduling.topologies` when KAI is enabled.
When Grove is also enabled, the same toggle sets Grove
`topologyAwareScheduling.enabled=true` and installs one
`ClusterTopologyBinding` per KAI `Topology`. The default topology labels are
`nvidia.com/gpu.clique` and `kubernetes.io/hostname`, in that order.

Enabling `addons.kaiScheduler.enabled` or `addons.dynamoOperator.enabled` also
adds the matching NVCA feature gate. Enabling KAI, Grove, or Dynamo permits
their workload resource types in the NVCA validation policy.

See [Gang Scheduling](../../../docs/user/cluster-management/gang-scheduling.md)
for atomic workload placement and
[Topology-Aware Scheduling](../../../docs/user/cluster-management/topology-aware-scheduling.md)
for GPU clique placement. See
[KAI Scheduler](../../../docs/user/cluster-management/kai-scheduler.md) for
queue configuration and standalone installation.

## Multi-Cluster Example

Each cluster is registered and installed independently. Pass `KUBECONFIG_FILE`
to every target so that registration reads the JWKS/issuer from the correct
cluster. Omitting it during `register-cluster` causes both clusters to register
with the ambient context's JWKS, which leads to PSAT auth failures at runtime.

```sh
make register-cluster \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-east \
  CLUSTER_REGION=us-east-1 \
  KUBECONFIG_FILE=~/.kube/gpu-east.yaml

make register-cluster \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-west \
  CLUSTER_REGION=us-west-2 \
  KUBECONFIG_FILE=~/.kube/gpu-west.yaml

make install \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-east \
  HELMFILE_ENV=<env> \
  KUBECONFIG_FILE=~/.kube/gpu-east.yaml

make install \
  CLUSTER_NAME=gpu-west \
  HELMFILE_ENV=<env> \
  KUBECONFIG_FILE=~/.kube/gpu-west.yaml
```
