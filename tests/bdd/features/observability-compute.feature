Feature: Install local Helmfile observability with the compute profile
  As a self-managed NVCF operator,
  I want to install the compute observability profile on a local split-cluster
  topology,
  so that the compute plane exports workload and NVCA metrics without running
  control-plane-only observability components.

  Background:
    Given environment variable "NGC_API_KEY" is set
    And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_ORG" is set
    And environment variable "SAMPLE_NGC_TEAM" is set
    And environment variable "NVCF_CLI" is set
    And environment variable "REPO_ROOT" is set
    # Helmfile pulls OCI charts during installation. Keep $NGC_API_KEY unbraced
    # so the BDD runner does not expand it into command logs.
    And command has succeeded:
      """
      bash -c 'set -eo pipefail; printf %s "$NGC_API_KEY" | helm registry login nvcr.io --username "\$oauthtoken" --password-stdin'
      """
    # Install only control-plane prerequisites on ncp-local-cp. Shared
    # observability is installed separately on the compute cluster below.
    And I copy the file "tests/bdd/fixtures/self-managed-local-bdd-multi.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/local-bdd-observability-compute.yaml"
    And I update yaml file "deploy/stacks/self-managed/environments/local-bdd-observability-compute.yaml" with keys:
      | global.imagePullSecrets[0].name | nvcr-pull-secret                     |

    And I copy the file "tests/bdd/fixtures/nvcf-compute-plane-local-bdd-multi.yaml" to "deploy/stacks/nvcf-compute-plane/environments/local-bdd-observability-compute.yaml"
